# TODO

 - double check for QueueName in ygord/config.go
 - implement a temporary and permanent voting system.
    - permanent would be something like "Light in the engineering room" and you can change your opinion constantly.
    - temporary would be "Should we go get cheese steak sandwiches for lunch?".
    - one could address the butler this way: "vote light on"
    - one could request a vote status with "vote light"
    - you can create a new poll with "add-vote http://stuff/vote-config.json"
 - make AliasFile and MinionsFile thread safe.
 - Remember the user id and refuse all messages for this minion.
 - run a routine to check the validity of the URL before sending it to the
   minion.
 - Validate the configuration (e.g. minion name should be [a-z0-9]+..)
 - LogFile parameter to dump everything to disk as well.
 - Imdb module (find film, get title from URL, etc.)
 - Count how many people are online.
 - play youtube
 - Look for 403 forbidden when caching.
 - aliases should take an argument to filter results
 - differentiate "command not found" and "access denied"-type issues.
