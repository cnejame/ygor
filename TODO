   minion.
 - Validate the configuration (e.g. minion name should be [a-z0-9]+..)
 - LogFile parameter to dump everything to disk as well.
 - Imdb module (find film, get title from URL, etc.)
 - Count how many people are online.
 - play random image or sound

 - Look for 403 forbidden when caching.
 - aliases should take an argument to filter results
