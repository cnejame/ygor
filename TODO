# TODO

 - make AliasFile thread safe.
 - clean-up post-move... too many go routines... bad error handling in ygorlet...
 - Remember the user id and refuse all messages for this minion.
 - define the alias and minions file path in the configuration file.
 - run a routine to check the validity of the URL before sending it to the
   minion.
 - Validate the configuration (e.g. minion name should be [a-z0-9]+..)
 - LogFile parameter to dump everything to disk as well.
 - Imdb module (find film, get title from URL, etc.)
 - Count how many people are online.
 - play random image or sound
 - play youtube
 - Look for 403 forbidden when caching.
