ygor - Go IRC bot (yes, another one)
====================================

Ygor is broken into three separate processes, a "body", a "soul" and a
"minion".

The body process acts as a conduit for the bots expression on IRC. It relays the i/o
from/to the IRC server almost as-is. The "soul" process receives i/o and acts
accordingly. The "minion" is a process receiving order from SQS, this process
would run on a separate machine (for example to drive music, dashboard, etc.).

The purpose of this design is to have a thin and stable connection layer that
would rarely change and never disconnect. The personality is modifyable and
reloadable without having to disconnect the bot.
